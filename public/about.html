        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <section id="poem_1">
          <p> THE cat went here and there <br>
And the moon spun round like a top, <br>
And the nearest kin of the moon, <br>
The creeping cat, looked up. <br>
Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon, <br>
For, wander and wail as he would,<br>
The pure cold light in the sky<br>
Troubled his animal blood.<br> </p>

<p >Minnaloushe runs in the grass<br>
Lifting his delicate feet<br>
Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?<br>
When two close kindred meet.<br>
What better than call a dance?<br>
Maybe the moon may learn,<br>
Tired of that courtly fashion,<br>
A new dance turn.<br> </p>

<p> Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br>
From moonlit place to place,<br>
The sacred moon overhead<br>
Has taken a new phase.<br> </p>

<p>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br>
Will pass from change to change,<br>
And that from round to crescent,<br>
From crescent to round they range?<br>
Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br>
Alone, important and wise,<br>
And lifts to the changing moon<br>
His changing eyes.<br> </p>
